            I am PhD student in physics at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid. I work in the low temperatures laboratory with a home made scanning tunneling microscopy able to observe atoms. My main research is studying superconductors at high magnetic fields
          </p><p>
          In my spare time I enjoy learning new things in programming, playing guitar and hiking on the mountains.
          </p><p>
          Here I will present some of my research and profesional activities and personal hobbies. Welcome!
